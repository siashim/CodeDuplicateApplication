# CodeDuplicateApplication
The idea behind this program was to make detection of code duplication in two different GiuHub repositories easier. By using a code duplicate detection tool called Simian, this program is able to notify the user if there are any code duplications in two different GitHub repositories. The user is asked to write the address for two different repositories, as well as the language used in writing the code in those depositories. The program then creates a folder in My Documents, and downloads the repositories to that folder. Then the program runs Simian, and gives it the address to the created directory, which allows Simian to go through the codes, and determine the location for any duplication available in those codes.
